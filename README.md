##  Setup and Installation

This is a static front-end project and requires no complex setup. To run it locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/Abhigidd/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/Abhigidd/your-repo-name.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

3.  **Open the `index.html` file in your browser.**

    For the best experience (to avoid any potential browser security issues with local files), it's recommended to serve the files using a simple local server. If you have Python installed, you can run:
    ```sh
    # For Python 3
    python -m http.server
    ```
    Then, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`.
